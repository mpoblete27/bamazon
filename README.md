Bamazon is terminal based shopping system. This program interfaces with my Bamazon database in MySQL Workbench.
Through the terminal window and by using Inquire, customers can view and purchase items (in this instance, cards from the game 'Magic: The Gathering').
The program allows direct interaction for customers with the data base and updates the stock for each item in real time.
Examples of user interaction can be seen  below as well as in the screenshots folder.
